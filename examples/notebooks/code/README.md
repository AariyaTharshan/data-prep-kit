## Demo Notebook

We can launch a jupyter notebook to try out the library or transforms or to build a usecase.


## Setup simple environment with Jupyter notebook

1. Prepare virtual env


```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install jupyter
deactivate
```

2. After dependancies are installed, we can launch the jupyter notebook


```
source venv/bin/activate
jupyter noetbook
```


It will launch browser with the jupyter notebook where we can try out the transforms.
